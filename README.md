Well, not tools, just an advent calendar, but it doesn't matter.

This is a vite+react+ts project with the experimental vite rolldown. Also i did it this time with pnpm instead of npm. It's the same

Yes you can run it locally. But you need: pnpm
step 1:
clone the repo with `git clone <url>` where <url> is the link to the page you are looking at right now 
step 2:
`cd` into that folder
step 3:
run: `pnpm install && pnpm run dev` i cant guarantee this works on windows idk i dont use it.
